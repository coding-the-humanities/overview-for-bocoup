Repos:
	So what do we have.
	We have a massively awesome TODO list, 
	in which we put everything that needs to be done yet, 
	kind of like a log book.
	We have our static website in unacademic_static,
	which has the most kickass CSS you've ever seen.
	I mean, look at that sweet blue shit, bro.
	Fucking amazing.
	We got the for realsies website in unacademic.
	That shit's gonna be like the main thing that
	will go on the interwebs.
	We got the CTH website in site, also hella rad.
	We got a bunch of other repo's, but those are not that
	interesting.
