We have four repositories that actually matter. The one this file is in is not one of those repo's.
The first is our TODO list, which encompasses everything we have to do on a week to week basis.
All files are written in MarkDown.
The second is unacademic_static. This is the static website of our curriculum. We're using Gulp to
generate our web page from yaml files by pasting them into handlebars. The website is static at the moment,
but we want to make it more dynamic in the near future.
Initially we were thinking about making our own file format, but we let that idea sail with the Northern wind. 
So long, .cth. You will be missed.
The third is the mobile app of unacademic. It's slightly more advanced than the website at the moment, but only slightly.
The fourth is obviously the best, as it is the website of Coding the Humanities itself. The repository is
called 'site'.
